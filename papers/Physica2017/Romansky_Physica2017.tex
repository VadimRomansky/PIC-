\begin{abstract}
	The problem of particle acceleration by the collisionless astrophysical shocks is of fundamental importance for the cosmic ray origin problem and the high energy astrophysics. The fast magnetohydrodynamical shocks produced by relativistic jets are considered as the very likely sites of the cosmic ray acceleration.
	While cosmic ray acceleration by both non-relativistic and ultra relativistic shocks was studied in some details the shocks of a moderate Lorentz factors has attracted much less attention so far, while they are important for modelling the gamma-ray burst afterglows and a number of other interesting objects. In this paper we present the results of simulations of relativistic shock waves in the electron-proton plasmas obtained with an implicit particle-in-cell code for the initial study the particle injection efficiencies.
