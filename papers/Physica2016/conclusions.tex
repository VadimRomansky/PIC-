\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we presented the developed 3D implicit particle-in-cell code, which can be applied for various problems in the collisionless plasma. We have tested it and obtained results, that are consistent with theoretical predictions. We studied the influence of admixture of heavy ions on the evolution of the shock wave and simulations have shown that the presence of heavy ions increases the number of accelerated particles. Further research is necessary in order to study this phenomena in detail.
