# PIC++
Particle in cell code

This code is designed for simulation of processes in astrophysical colisionless plasma. 
Two optional numerical schemes are implemented:

-implicit scheme developed by G. Lapenta, J. Brackbill, S. Markidis, K. Noguchi, M. Innocenti and others.

-explicit scheme developed by O. Buneman, A. Spitkovsky and others

we suggest that our code can be more suitable for special astrophysical tasks than original codes, becuause allows to use a lot of different particle types
